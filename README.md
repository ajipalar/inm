## AP-MS PPI Benchmark 

Prey were taken from the authors exactly.
The following prey were excluded from the analysis

- IGHG1\_MOUSE


Viral proteins were mapped to the uniprot identifier with
the longest sequence by keyword search.

- vifprotein          :   P69723 
- polpolyprotein      :   Q2A7R5 
- nefprotein          :   P18801
- tatprotein          :   P0C1K3
- gagpolyprotein      :   P12493
- revprotein          :   P69718
- envpolyprotein      :   O12164
